# AIoT Smart Agriculture System

This project utilizes the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), combining AI technologies with IoT infrastructure to create more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions, and enhance data management and analytics. The focus of this project is on applying AIoT technology to smart agriculture scenarios.

Environmental sensory data is periodically recorded and uploaded to an IoT server for remote monitoring. In the context of agriculture, the temperature and humidity of air and soil conditions (temperature, humidity, and electrical conductivity) are required to monitor. Actuators, such as pumps, fans, or LEDs, can be controlled automatically or manually based on user configurations. An IoT dashboard is built, either as a web or mobile application, to provide a friendly user interface.

The most interesting aspect of this project is the implementation of a simple AI system. Data collected from a webcam camera is used to train the AI core, enabling the system to recognize unusual plant pictures and provide alarms to end-users. The AI core acts like an advanced sensor in a smart agriculture system.

Python (version 3.8.5 recommended) is the primary programming language used in this project. The Raspberry PI platform is suggested.
